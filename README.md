## Description
This is just a silly project I'm working on as I learn C# for my job, posted publicly with permission of my boss. 
I wanted to create something that isn't just an isolated language exercise when studying C#, especially since I need to learn unit testing in NUnit.
I come from a Java and Python background professionally, and I'm learning the nuances of C# as I go. It is definitely more than "Microsoft Java".
This tool is designed to judge your choice of Synthwave artist. I may expand it to more genres in the future.

***
## Eventual Goals:
- Implemening more Object Oriented Code like defining a class to represeent an artist.
- Loading JSON or XML that artist definitions are stored in.
- Writing tests for the tool using NUnit.
